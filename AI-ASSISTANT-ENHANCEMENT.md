## What Was Built

### 1. Comprehensive ERP Knowledge Base (`ERPKnowledgeBase.ts`)
The AI now knows EVERYTHING about the ERP system:

- **All 25+ Modules** - Financial, Sales, Purchase, Inventory, HR, Assets, Banking, Projects, Manufacturing, Healthcare, Construction, Property, Agriculture, Mining, and more
- **Module Capabilities** - What each module can do
- **Navigation** - How to get to each feature
- **Common Questions** - Pre-built Q&A for each module
- **Workflows** - Step-by-step processes (Sales Cycle, Purchase Cycle, Month-end Close, Payroll)
- **SA Compliance** - VAT, PAYE, UIF, SDL, POPIA, CIPC
- **Glossary** - Business and accounting terms explained simply
- **Troubleshooting** - Common problems and solutions

### 2. Machine Learning System (`AILearningService.ts`)
The AI learns and improves from every conversation:

- **Conversation Storage** - Every interaction is saved for learning
- **Feedback Loop** - Users can mark responses as helpful/unhelpful
- **Pattern Recognition** - Learns successful response patterns
- **FAQ Generation** - Automatically creates FAQs from common questions
- **User Preferences** - Remembers each user's preferred response style
- **Analytics** - Tracks conversation topics, success rates, trends

### 3. Database Tables (PostgreSQL)
New tables created for AI learning:

```sql
ai_conversations      -- Stores all conversations for learning
ai_learned_patterns   -- Successful response patterns
ai_faq               -- Frequently asked questions
ai_user_preferences  -- Personalization per user
```

Pre-seeded with **15 common FAQs** about invoices, reconciliation, payroll, VAT, etc.

### 4. New API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/ai/feedback/:id` | POST | Record feedback (helpful/unhelpful) |
| `/api/ai/faq` | GET | Get FAQs for help center |
| `/api/ai/analytics` | GET | AI usage analytics |
| `/api/ai/knowledge` | GET | Full ERP knowledge base |
| `/api/ai/knowledge/search` | GET | Search knowledge base |

## How The AI Works Now

### When User Asks a Question:

1. **Knowledge Search** - First searches the ERP knowledge base for relevant info
2. **Pattern Matching** - Checks learned patterns from past successful responses  
3. **Context Loading** - Gets user's recent conversations and preferences
4. **OpenAI Processing** - Sends enriched context to GPT-4o-mini
5. **Response Generation** - Returns helpful, conversational answer
6. **Learning Storage** - Saves conversation for future learning

### System Prompt Features:

The AI has been upgraded with:
- Complete module knowledge
- South African compliance awareness
- Step-by-step navigation guidance
- Troubleshooting expertise
- Simple business language (not accounting jargon)
- Proactive suggestions

## Example Interactions

**User:** "How do I create an invoice?"
**AI:** "Go to Sales Hub → New Invoice. Select your customer, add line items with quantities and prices, review the totals including VAT, then click Save or Save & Send to email it directly. Would you like me to walk you through it step by step?"

**User:** "When is VAT due?"
**AI:** "VAT returns are due by the 25th of the month following your VAT period. For example, if your period ends on 30 November, your return is due by 25 December. Go to SARS Sentinel to see your upcoming deadlines and prepare your return."

**User:** "My trial balance doesn't balance"
**AI:** "Let's troubleshoot this. Check for: 1) Unposted journal entries, 2) Suspended transactions, 3) Opening balance errors, 4) Rounding issues. Go to Financial Hub → Reports → Trial Balance and look at any accounts with unusual balances. Would you like help identifying the discrepancy?"

## Configuration Required

For the AI to work, ensure these environment variables are set:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

The AI uses GPT-4o-mini which costs approximately **R0.50-2 per customer per month** at typical usage.
