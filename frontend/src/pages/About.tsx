            <p>
              AetherOS is the flagship enterprise resource planning platform developed by 
              <strong> Masaphokati Technologies</strong>, a South African company dedicated to 
              transforming the fintech and enterprise software landscape. We believe that 
              business management systems should serve business owners—not just accountants.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our mission is to bridge the gap between operational excellence and financial 
              clarity, empowering businesses across Africa and beyond to make informed decisions 
              with real-time, accurate data.

                <h3>Sibusiso Mavuso</h3>
                <p className="founder-title">Founder & CEO, Masaphokati Technologies</p>
                <p>
                  Sibusiso Mavuso is a qualified accountant and the founder of a thriving 
                  accounting practice based in Centurion, South Africa. Through years of 
                  hands-on experience serving businesses across multiple industries, he 
                  witnessed a recurring pain point: traditional business systems were built 
                  for accountants, not for business owners.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This fundamental disconnect resulted in chronic challenges—document backlogs, 
                  failed audits, fragmented data across multiple platforms, and business owners 
                  unable to gauge whether their ventures were growing or stagnating. Without 
                  real-time, unified insights, strategic decision-making became guesswork.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Driven by a passion to solve these problems, Sibusiso embarked on a journey 
                  to study systems architecture and software development. His goal was singular: 
                  to create a platform that bridges the gap between business owners and their 
                  financial reality—making enterprise-grade tools accessible, intuitive, and 
                  genuinely useful.
                </p>
                <p>
                  AetherOS is the culmination of that vision—a system designed from the ground 
                  up to serve the people who run businesses, not just the people who audit them.
