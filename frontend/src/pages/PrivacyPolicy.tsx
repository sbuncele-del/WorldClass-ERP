              <h2>7. Cross-Border Data Transfers</h2>
              <p>
                Our primary data processing occurs in South Africa. Where we transfer personal information 
                to countries outside South Africa (e.g., for cloud hosting), we ensure that:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>The recipient country has adequate data protection laws, or</li>
                <li>Appropriate safeguards are in place (binding corporate rules, standard contractual clauses), or</li>
                <li>You have provided explicit consent for the transfer</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                We primarily use AWS (Amazon Web Services) data centers with options for South African 
                or European hosting to minimize cross-border transfers.
